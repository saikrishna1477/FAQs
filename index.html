        <!-- FAQ 1 -->

            <div class="faq_text">
                <h2>Does anyone audit Corporate Audit?</h2>
                <p>Believe it or not - we get audited a lot as well.
                    Each audit that we complete goes through an audit called Vertical Quality Assurance Review (QAR) that focuses on every aspect and stage of the audit from start to finish (hence vertical). This review is performed by our India-based KPMG consultants who were not part of the audit itself.
                    Every year, we assemble a team of experienced auditors and India-based KPMG consultants, who under the direction of a vice president, select 15 audits and assess it for additional parameters of quality, sufficiency, compliance to Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) standards and consistency. This review is called a Horizontal QAR as each audit is evaluated for consistency across any given stage (e.g., planning, fieldwork, reporting). The results of this review are presented to head of audit, and the Audit Committee.
                    Finally, every five years, a thorough and completely independent External QAR is completed by a qualified, independent assessor or assessment team - typically a reputed professional services firm like KPMG or Protiviti. The results of this review are presented by a senior leader of that firm directly to the audit committee and senior management.  </p>
